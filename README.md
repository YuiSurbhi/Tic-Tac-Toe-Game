## Overview üìú

This project is a basic implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.<br>

 ## Features
‚óªÔ∏è **Player Input:** Enter a number between 1 and 9 to make your move.<br>
‚óªÔ∏è **Computer Move:** The computer selects a random available position.<br>
‚óªÔ∏è **Winning Conditions:** Checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.<br>
‚óªÔ∏è **Tie Condition:** Ends the game if the board is full and no winner is found.<br>
‚óªÔ∏è **Board Display:** Shows the current state of the board after each move.<br>

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer.<br>
2. **Clone the Repository:** Get the code onto your local machine.<br>

       git clone https://github.com/YuiSurbhi/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game.git
       cd Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
      
3. **Run the Script:** Execute the game script with Python.

       python main.py

4. **Play the Game:** Follow the prompts to play. Enter a number between 1 and 9 to make your move!

## How to Play üìù

1. **Start the Game:** Run the Python script to begin the game.<br>

2. **Player Move:**

- You‚Äôll be prompted to enter a number from 1 to 9. Each number corresponds to a position on the board:<br>

      1 | 2 | 3
      ---------
      4 | 5 | 6
      ---------
      7 | 8 | 9

- Choose an empty spot to place your mark. If the spot is already occupied, you'll need to pick another one.<br>

3. **Computer Move:**
- After your move, the computer will make its move automatically.<br>
- The computer selects a random empty spot to place its mark ("O").<br>

4. **Win or Tie:**

- If a player wins or if all spots are filled (a tie), the game will display the result and end.<br>
